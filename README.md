Github API makes it a lot easier when extracting information via the API.First task on recieving the url was to build the url appropriate to make api calls, split functions and concat operator pretty much did the job jfor me.
After making the first call the response was a lot if info about the repository.To get the total number of open issues I had to extract the value of 'open_issues' field.Now gitapi returns 30 results per page.Dividing total number of issues with 30 gave the number of pages.Then in a loop made a request to each page and extracted the timestamp of each issue and appended it to the list.Then convert each date into date object so that we can compare dates.Next get the current time, past 7 day timestamp using datetime.Finally compare the timestamps and  increment the count when they satisfy the appropriate condition and return the result.The html template renders the result and displays it in a tabular form.
